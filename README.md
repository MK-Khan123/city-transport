### `Project Features`

In this project, we practically applied the functional concepts of React Authentication along with our previous knowledge of React Routing. 

1. User can book tickets based on their preferred ride from the homepage but he/she needs to login first. Applied Private Route (also known as Protected Route/ Authenticated Route) to restrict convenient access.

2. Implemented Google and Facebook sign in method using Firebase Authentication. Users can also create their account (if they donâ€™t have any) and details are stored on Firebase.

3. When user signs in, they can select a ride and by providing ride details, they will be able to see the cost (fakeData) and pick & drop location along with a static map. We generated fakeData in JSON format and used route parameter to display data dynamically, prompted through unique interactions.

4. In addition, we used plain bootstrap to make the website device responsive (for mobile and desktop version). Furthermore, we deployed our site on Netlify which can be accessed through the above mentioned link to experience the website.
