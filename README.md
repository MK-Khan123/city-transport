### `Project Features`

In this project, we practically applied the functional concepts of React Authentication along with our previous knowledge of React Routing. We generated fakeData in JSON format and used route parameter to display data dynamically, prompted through unique interaction. We applied Private Route (also known as Protected Route/ Authenticated Route) to restrict convenient access under certain conditions. In addition, we used plain bootstrap to make the website device responsive. Furthermore, we deployed our site on Netlify which can be accessed through the above mentioned link to experience the website.

Thank you.
