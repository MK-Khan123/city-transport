This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Netlify Live Site Link

The project was deployed at Netlify and you can access the link by clicking here [Netlify Live Site Link](https://practical-joliot-41cf3a.netlify.app/).

### `Technology Used`

* React.js
* React Router (5.2.0)
* Firebase Authentication
* Context API
* Bootstrap 5.0
* Netlify

### `Project Features`

In this project, I had the opportunity to practically apply the functional concepts of React Authentication along with my previous knowledge of React Routing. 

1. User can book tickets based on their preferred ride from the homepage but he/she needs to login first. Applied Private Route (also known as Protected Route/ Authenticated Route) to restrict convenient access.

2. Implemented Google and Facebook sign in method using Firebase Authentication. Users can also create their account (if they donâ€™t have any) and details are stored on Firebase.

3. When a user logs in, they can select a ride. By providing ride details, they will be able to see the cost (fakeData) and pick & drop location along with a static map. I generated fakeData in JSON format and used route parameter to display data dynamically, prompted through unique interactions.

4. In addition, I used plain bootstrap to make the website device responsive (for mobile and desktop version). Furthermore, I deployed the site on Netlify which can be accessed through the above mentioned link.
